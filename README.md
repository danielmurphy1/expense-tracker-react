### Summary

I created this application to learn how to use React. Previously, I had created a similar expense tracker using HTML and vanilla JavaScript (You can access my previous app [here](https://danielmurphy1.github.io/ExpenseTracker/)).

This is the first application that I created using React. It was interesting to create this application using React knowing that I had already created a very similar one without it. To do so, I had to shift my thinking into how React tracks and updates the virtual DOM, rather than just manipulating the DOM using standard JavaScript in the previous application. I learned the basics of state and props - namely how to update state and pass it as props to other components in order to manipulate the virtual DOM rather than direct DOM manipulation of HTML elements as in standard JavaScript. This application was also my first venture into using Bootstrap for styling.
