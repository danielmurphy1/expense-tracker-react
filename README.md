### Summary

I created this application to learn how to use React. Previously, I had created a similar expense tracker using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript (You can access my previous app [here](https://danielmurphy1.github.io/ExpenseTracker/)).

Creating this application was my first attempt at using React. It was interesting to create this application using React knowing that I had already created a very similar one wihout it. In doing so, I had to shift my thinking into how React tracks and updates the Virtual DOM, rather than just manipulating the DOM using standard JavaScript in the previous application. To do so, I had to learn the basics of state and props, and to rely on updating and passing those to the components rather than DOM manipulation in standard JavaScript. This application was also my first venture into using Bootstrap for styling, which I enjoyed to learn and was able to see the potential to use it for styling in future projects.
